# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to show how the different campaigns fared in relation to launch dates & funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

I performed my analysis by taking information from the Kickstarter sheet, and creating pivot tables from the data, to give a visualization to the data, so it can be better understood.  The challenges I faced were figuring out the Countifs formulas for the "Outcomes Based on Goals" sheet and graph.  It took me some time to figure out the correct order of everything in the formula, in order to have the right number.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- Two conclusions I can draw about the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" pivot table and chart are, that May was the most successful month when it came to theater, and there were not many total of canceled theaters.

- From the "Outcomes Based on Goals" chart, I can conclude that the goal of $45,000-$49,999 had both the lowest percentage successful, yet also the highest percentage failed.

- Some limitations with the dataset include, that the success rate and goal amount were really only looked at for plays.  Only a couple categories were looked at in depth.

- Other tables or graphs that could be created, might include showing the comparison of the launch date, to what the deadline was, and see if any launched late, and try to find a trend if there was a particular reason.
